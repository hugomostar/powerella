## Project Overview

This is a Next.js and Tailwind CSS project, specifically a blog, based on the "Spotlight" template from Tailwind Plus. It uses MDX for writing articles, which are stored in the `src/app/articles` directory. The project is written in TypeScript.

The main page, located at `src/app/page.tsx`, displays a hero section, social media links, a photo gallery, a list of recent articles, and a newsletter signup form. Articles are dynamically loaded and rendered from MDX files.
